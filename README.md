Design and implement your own simple class to represent any household item of your choice (toaster, fan, hair dryer, piano â€¦) Your class should have a constructor, one additional method and at least one member variable (e.g. boolean isOn to turn the item on or off). Be sure you demonstrate your class works properly by constructing an instance of it and calling your method.
